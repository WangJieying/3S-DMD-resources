1. Put the test image into the 'Image' file, and its corresponding saliency map into the 'SaliencyMap' file. 

2. The generated compression ratio and quality score can be found in the 'outputFile' file.

3. You can execute the whole pipeline by running './evaluation' in the 'Code' file. Note that please change 'cd /home/jieying/Desktop/SkelCode/3SDMD_code/Code/imConvert' in the 'evaluation' to your own address. And also make sure that you have 'matlab' installed (to calculated the quality score).
